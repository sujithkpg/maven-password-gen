# Maven Dependency Security Automation

We have introduced a security solution to ensure that Maven dependencies are downloaded only by authorized users. We use Artifactory to manage dependencies, and access is controlled through user credentials.

## Steps to Configure Maven with Artifactory

### 1. Create `settings-security.xml`

Navigate to the `.m2` folder and create a `settings-security.xml` file with the following content:


```xml
<settingsSecurity>
   <master>master_password</master>
</settingsSecurity>


Automating the Process
Since Artifactory passwords change every two months, you need to regenerate and update these passwords periodically. To automate this process, you can use a Java application.

Java Automation Solution
The Java application will:

Get the Maven path (default if not specified).
Generate settings-security.xml if it does not exist.
Prompt for the master password.
Generate the master password.
Update settings-security.xml with the new master password.
Generate settings.xml if it does not exist.
Generate the Artifactory password.
Update settings.xml with the new Artifactory password.
Ensure you provide the Maven path and Java path either in a property file or as command-line arguments to the Java application.
